1: Assignment Description
    For this final project, you will transform your midterm “Wild West Forum” into a secure,
    production-ready web application. This project builds directly on your midterm implementation,
    adding database persistence, security features, user profiles, password recovery,
    real-time chat functionality, and enhanced comment features.
    The application must use SQLite3 for data persistence, implement proper security measures
    (password hashing, account lockout, HTTPS), provide user profile management, support password
    recovery via email, include a real-time chat system using Socket.io, and implement pagination for
    comment history.

2 Core Requirements
    2.5 Password Recovery System (OPTIONAL???)
        - Implement “Forgot Password” functionality:
            – Add a “Forgot Password” link on the login page
            – User enters their email address
            – Generate a secure, time-limited password reset token
            – Store reset token in database with expiration timestamp
            – Send password reset email containing a link with the token
            – Email should include instructions and expiration time
        - Create password reset page:
            – Accept reset token via URL parameter
            – Validate token exists and hasn’t expired
            – Allow user to enter new password
            – Validate new password meets requirements
            – Hash and store new password
            – Invalidate the reset token after use
            – Redirect to login page with success message
        - Email Configuration:
            – Configure email service (Gmail)
            – Document email configuration in README

3 Testing Requirements
You must demonstrate that your system works correctly with:
    - User registration with email and display name
    - Login with account lockout after failed attempts
    - Password hashing and verification
    - Profile page functionality (change password, email, display name, customization)
    - Password recovery via email
    - Real-time chat functionality
    - Comment pagination
    - At least three additional comment features
    - HTTPS connection
    - Database persistence (data survives container restarts)

4 Code Quality Requirements
    - Include comprehensive comments explaining security measures
    - Organize code into logical modules/files
    - Handle edge cases appropriately (expired tokens, locked accounts, etc.)
    - Provide clear error messages for users
    - Ensure code is readable and well-structured
    - Use consistent coding style
    - Implement proper error handling and logging

5 Documentation Requirements
You must provide:
    - A comprehensive README.md file that includes:
        – Instructions on how to set up and run the application
        – Database schema documentation
        – Environment variables and configuration requirements
        – Nginx Proxy Manager setup instructions
        – Email service configuration
        – Security features implemented
        – API endpoint documentation (for chat API)
        – Known limitations or issues
    - Inline code comments explaining complex security implementations
    - Documentation of design decisions and trade-offs

7 Submission Requirements
You must submit the following:
    - Link to your public GitHub repository (must be the same repository from midterm, with new commits)
    - Link to your hosted website (with HTTPS)
    - A link to a video demonstrating:
        – User registration with email and display name
        – Login with account lockout demonstration
        – Profile page features (changing password, email, display name, customization)
        – Password recovery flow
        – Real-time chat functionality
        – Comment pagination
        – Your chosen feature
        – HTTPS connection verification
    - Updated README.md with all required documentation

8 Additional Notes
    - This project builds on your midterm, but make it it’s own repository (create a branch
      off your midterm repository, and then merge that branch into your main branch when
      you’re done).
    - Start early! This is a substantial project requiring multiple complex features.
    - Test security features thoroughly (try to break your own system).
    - Consider user experience when implementing features.
    - Make sure your database schema is well-designed before implementing features.
    - Document your security decisions and trade-offs in your README.
